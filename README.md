# Casino_Game

I have created a mini game named 'Casino' for fun.

In this game you can enter amount and play till the amount becomes 0 or till you wish to.

The rules of the games are :-
1) Choose any number between 1 to 10.
2) If you choose the same number as the machine chooses then you win and will be awarded with the betting amount.
3) If you choosed the different number then the betting amount will be deducted from your total deposited amount.
4) If your deposited ammount becomes 0 while playing the casino then you are not allowed to play the game anymore.
